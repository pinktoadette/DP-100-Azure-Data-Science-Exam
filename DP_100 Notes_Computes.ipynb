    "<ul><li>Local compute - You can specify a local compute target for most processing tasks in Azure Machine Learning. This runs the experiment on the same compute target as the code used to initiate the experiment, which may be your physical workstation or a virtual machine such as an Azure Machine Learning compute instance on which you are running a notebook. Local compute is generally a great choice during development and testing with low to moderate volumes of data.</li>\n",
    "<li>Compute clusters - For experiment workloads with high scalability requirements, you can use Azure Machine Learning compute clusters; which are multi-node clusters of Virtual Machines that automatically scale up or down to meet demand. This is a cost-effective way to run experiments that need to handle large volumes of data or use parallel processing to distribute the workload and reduce the time it takes to run.</li>\n",
    "<li>Attached compute - If you already use an Azure-based compute environment for data science, such as a virtual machine or an Azure Databricks cluster, you can attach it to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and use it as a compute target for certain types of workload.</li>\n",
